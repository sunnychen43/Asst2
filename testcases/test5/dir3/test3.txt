Former graduate student in natural resources, Nirav Patel’s research is focused on renewable energy education. He uses environmental psychology and cognitive science within education domains to understand the environmental behaviors of K-12 educators and their students. Patel has been involved with Cornell’s Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning, which awarded him a travel grant to present his research at a national conference. Currently a research scholar and director of experiential learning at Rutgers University, Patel hopes “to help train the next generation of community-engaged scholars focused on issues such as sustainable food, energy, and water.”
