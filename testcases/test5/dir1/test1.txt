The Empire stands triumphant.

For twenty years the Dread Empress has 
ruled over the lands that were once the Kingdom of Callow, 
but behind the scenes of this dawning golden age threats to 
the crown are rising. The nobles of the Wasteland, denied the
 power they crave, weave their plots behind pleasant smiles.
 In the north the Forever King eyes the ever-expanding borders
 of the Empire and ponders war. The greatest danger lies to the west, 
where the First Prince of Procer has finally claimed her throne: 
her people sundered, she wonders if a crusade might not be the way 
to secure her reign. Yet none of this matters, for in the heart of
 the conquered lands the most dangerous man alive sat across an
 orphan girl and offered her a knife.

Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she has a plan.
